<div class="about-tans"> <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Hello, and welcome to Spray Tans By Evan! I am thrilled to have you.
    
    For those of you that donâ€™t know me, my name is Evan Boles and I am a mobile spray tan artist based out of Mandeville, Louisiana working to spread skin care awareness across all genders through sunless tanning. I have been in the sunless tanning industry for over two years and have completed over 400 spray tans, both mobile and in-studio. In August of 2022 I took a chance on myself and invested in my talent and appreciation for sunless tanning and opened Spray Tans By Evan. My mission with Spray Tans By Evan is to bring modern spray tans to the comfort of your own home or business, deliver seamless results every time, bust all spray tan myths  and educate my clients. I strive to educate my clients on why sunless tanning is a healthier investment, and to emphasize the importance of daily SPF protection. As a person with fair skin, I understand the desire to achieve a natural glow without the risk of harmful UV rays and sun damage, and it brings me joy to provide that for you. I vow to put your comfort first and ensure a judge-free zone; I promise you, I have seen it all!
    
    With several shades to choose from, I have a little something for everyone and their individual needs. Please always feel free to reach out to me, for I have an open-door policy and would love to chat.
    
    I look forward to tanning you!
    <br>
    <br>
    Sincerely your friend,
    <br>
    Evan Marie Boles
